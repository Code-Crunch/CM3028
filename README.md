New Functionality

All the pages redirect to reasonable pages EXCEPT Book and Module edits and Adds, these point to index. 

All redirect code is relative and automated.

All forms prevent MySQL and HTML injections.

All the data entry forms are verified!
 

Further Notes
The MySQL DB export attached is my current DB.
I have tested these to a certain extent, but nothing too serious. If you find ANY bugs, let me know!
