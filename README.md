I HAVE NOT TESTED ALL THE CHANGES!!! I SIMPLY REPLACED THE SQL AREAS I NEEDED TO AND LEFT IT AT THAT. MOST OF THE CHANGES WERE TESTED}

MS: Sam, I was getting errors in the final code, had to make some chenges to correct it. Made small 		changes in the following files: You can find it with a small comment //MS
	books.php
	modules.php
	addModule.php
	addBook.php
Otherwise works great!
